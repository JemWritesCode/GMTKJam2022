# GMTKJam2022

Our work from making our game for the [GMTK Game Jam!](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022) The theme was "roll of the dice" and we decided to let players "roll the dice" with the stock market with our game, [Unlimited Tendies 2](https://jemwritescode.itch.io/unlimited-tendies-2)! Unlimited Tendies 1 was lost in a bad investment.
